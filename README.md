## This project is an online shopping page. The idea behind this is to create an online store with products on display. For creativity, I made use of Bootstrap5 in my program.

3. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies used for building web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, while CSS is used to style the page and lay it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.
    * There are three ways to add CSS to an HTML document:
      1. Inline: by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
      2. Internal: by using a <style> element in the <head> section of the HTML document.
      3. External: by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.
    * The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. This allows you to change the look of an entire website by changing just one file.

## Instructions
Follow these steps:
Please implement all of the below features by making use of Bootstrap in your program:

1. Items
    * Add 10 items to the page.
    * Use the grid system.
    * Have your images become responsive (make them change when the user moves their mouse over them).
    * Have your page display a price and name for each product.
    * Include a button under each product to “buy” the product (this does not need to be functional yet!)

2. Footer
    * Create a horizontal form.

    * Include a small company logo next to the form.
